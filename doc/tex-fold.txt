1. Usage                                                       *tex-fold-usage*

The tex-fold plugin provides a custom |foldexpr| function using regular
expressions to fold LaTeX documents. When it is enabled,
it will fold sections and environments defined with begin and end.
Also if specified, it will fold based on |foldmaker|.

2. Options                                                   *tex-fold-options*

Use these options to customize tex-fold:

                                                 *g:tex_fold_override_foldtext*
Use tex-folds own foldtext function instead of the builtin one: >
  let g:tex_fold_override_foldtext = 1
<
                                                          *g:tex_fold_sec_char*
Set the string to prepend the foldtext for sections: >
  let g:tex_fold_sec_char = 'ยง'
<
                                                          *g:tex_fold_env_char*
Set the string to prepend the foldtext for environments: >
  let g:tex_fold_env_char = 'โฏ'
<
                                                      *g:tex_fold_allow_marker*
Besides folding sections and environments, allow vim to fold by fold markers.
This feature is disable by default: >
  let g:tex_fold_allow_marker = 0
<
                                                            *g:tex_fold_marker*
Set the custom fold markers as a list: >
  let g:tex_fold_marker = ['{{{','}}}']
<
                                                              *g:tex_fold_envs*
By default, tex-fold does not fold any blocks between \begin and \end.
You can specify the list of environmets which you want to fold: >
  let g:tex_fold_envs = []
<
vim: ft=help
